# Hi, I'm Nishma

I'm a senior Angular developer with a proven track record in implementing 
innovative projects across healthcare, finance, and telecommunications 
domains. My expertise lies in mastering JavaScript-based stacks,
 particularly with a focus on Angular, while adeptly leveraging 
 technologies like Redux, Flux, Common.JS, Babel+ES6, EXT JS, and 
 Webpack for crafting cutting-edge single-page applications.
