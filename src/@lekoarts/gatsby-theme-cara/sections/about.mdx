## About

I'm a senior Angular developer with a proven track record in spearheading innovative projects across healthcare, finance, and telecommunications domains. My expertise lies in mastering JavaScript-based stacks, particularly with a focus on Angular, while adeptly leveraging technologies like Redux, Flux, Common.JS, Babel+ES6, EXT JS, and Webpack for crafting cutting-edge single-page applications.

As an Angular 9 expert, my forte encompasses TypeScript, Angular Material, Bootstrap, and PrimeNG for creating seamless UI designs. With an in-depth understanding of Angular CLI, I specialize in custom module, directive, and pipe development, consistently achieving over 90% test coverage. I have a remarkable history of driving service development and Angular migrations, ensuring unparalleled performance.

My comprehensive skill set extends to MERN stack development, React Native for cross-platform mobile applications, MongoDB, NodeJS, and proficiency in various JavaScript packages. I am well-versed in version control systems, Docker, AWS services, and Java application development within the Spring Framework and Microservices architecture. Adept in Linux, shell scripting, and Agile/Waterfall methodologies, I excel in delivering exceptional project development solutions.
